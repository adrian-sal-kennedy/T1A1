Q1 - History of the Internet
----------------------------

### Rough Timeline:

- 1843 - Ada Lovelace publishes the [first ever algorithm specifically meant to be run on a computer][1] (Charles Babbage's Analytical engine, which sadly was never actually completed so the program never run).

- 1844 - [Samuel Morse][2] sends "WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT" 71km from Washington to Baltimore over a telegraph. Telegraph technology had been a curiosity since the early days of the discovery of electricity, but only from 1838 onward did it see any practical commercial use, when voltages could be made high enough to counter losses (power loss is proportional to current squared, so low current and high voltage works best for distance) and systems using less (therefore cheaper) wiring could be built to cover large distances.

- 1940's - Alan Turing and John Von Neumann. Legends. Invented computers as we know them.

- 1962 - [J.C.R. Licklider at MIT discusses][3] his “Galactic Network” concept in a series of memos. Later worked on ARPANET. The idea was conceptually very similar to the Internet.

- 1969 - ARPANET's first node installed at UCLA [\[3\]][3]

- 1989 - Using Steve Jobs' "Gap year" flagship product, the NeXT computer, [Tim Berners Lee][4] invented HTTP and a line-mode browser was developed to use it. I haven't used a greentext computer since 1990 and looking at CERN's emulation of such, I'm glad.

- 1991 - Al Gore [confuses legislation and enthusiasm for invention][5] and drafted the bill *High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991*. To his credit, the Mosaic browser (and later Netscape) would not have been developed without the funding included in that bill. So perhaps Gore really did invent the Internet.

- 1995 - [Windows '95 is released][6]. This doesn't seem so significant, but it heralded a massive boost in home computer sales. Suddenly they were less dorky, but not elitist or expensive like macs were. Windows came pre-installed on mass produced OEM computers. Families would buy the whole deal - Computer, CD-ROM, dial-up modem. With that modem came your choice of kicking it old school with BBS services, or using AOL (I actually had this!) or Netscape and Internet Explorer.

I could certainly list a lot in between. Myself, the most significant moments were:
- The advent of IM platforms (I never did ICQ, but certainly MSN Messenger played a big part of keeping up with friends)
- FutureSplash / Macromedia Flash bringing rich content for so many years until (thank God) HTML5 did away with the need for it.
- Internet forums. Sprung from mailing lists but far less arcane.
- 4chan - This dumpster fire of a site has been easily as culture-defining as The Simpsons was to my generation.
- Wikileaks. Showing the world some of the things you can use the Internet for.
- Facebook. I hate it, I really do. But there's no denying the influence it's had in shaping the whole of society.
- Cambridge Analytica and all that came with it.
- The BitTorrent protocol. Not only did it make up a good whack of all online traffic for a long time, it served as the prototype for expensive transfer systems like Aspera.
- Netflix and YouTube. Killed TV. Good riddance. Also killed most piracy unless you're wanting Game Of Thrones (as an ex film guy - just steal it, we already got paid. Don't shed a tear for the licensor because it's Murdoch).
